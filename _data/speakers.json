	"talk": "Are you responsible for the code you write? Ask the Volkswagen engineer who’s in prison for creating software that allowed their cars to “cheat” on emissions tests. Or think of the ethical issues if you’re programming IoT devices that spy on users and report back to the company. The technology we create affects people’s lives. We need to be aware of how much power we’ve been given and start taking responsibility for what we build.",

	"talk": "npm started out as a back-end tool for node.js developers writing server-side applications, but has become the tool of choice for front-end developers writing rich web applications. More than 80% of npm users are writing front-end code! This was a big change, so npm 5 was a big change to meet the needs of this new type of user. Now with npm 6, we’re refining that focus. This talk covers best practices for npm 6, including ways to dramatically improve your build times, how to use our new security features, and talk about what’s coming up for npm. In the second half, I cover what npm knows about JavaScript developers based on our survey of over 16,000 developers, what that means for the future of JavaScript, and the tooling and language choices the data suggests you should make as a developer today.",

	"talk": "<p>This talk will focus on uses for service workers, with special focus on Offline First and intermittent connectivity. Intermittent internet connection is something many people in the United States face, and it’s a huge hurdle to complete simple tasks like finding a bank balance – or even more important tasks like searching for employment.</p><p>In a world divided by those who are connected, and those who aren’t, developers are in a unique position to help by writing apps with an Offline First focus. This particular talk focuses on using service workers to improve a user’s experience when connection is lost.</p><p>Service workers cache assets like HTML pages, pictures and even JavaScript files within the user’s browser. Once the assets are cached, the browser will load directly from the cache making the entire loading process faster. Even better, because the assets are already in the browser, the page will load without an Internet connection!</p><p>This talk will introduce service workers, explore use cases, and teach the audience how to implement service workers in their apps. We’ll also touch on other great features of service workers like background sync and push notifications.</p>",

	"talk": "<p>Developers want to write better, faster, safer code. They want to do it quickly, consistently, and happily.</p><p>The problem is we’ve chosen the wrong tools. We obsess over the wrong metrics. We fetishize the structure and organization of the enemy with “clean code”. “Clean code” promised a future of fun and flexibility but results only in another master, vying for your precious time and attention.</p><p>I’ve fought for “clean code” my 10 years as a developer. For 10 years I lost and kept losing to this monster I was creating. I was taking my team with me. Now I empower devs and designers in the war against “clean code”. I want developers and designers to win and keep winning.</p><p>After identifying the enemy, I’ll demonstrate the shape a component takes when “clean code” is dogma. I’ll then write the same component as hot-garbage. I’ll show everyone how to create and compose in a way that prepares for the future but doesn’t bother to predict it.</p><p>The talk will be very practical and entertaining intro to a topic better known as “composite component design”.</p>",
